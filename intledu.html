  document.getElementById('paragraph').innerHTML="<h3> Living Expense</h3><p>Cost of living in Japan is the high. The average monthly expense (tuition fees not included) for typical Students is JPY 145,000. This will include an average rent of JPY 53,200 (for a single person)・JPY 103,800 (for family) and an average cost of food JPY 32,200 (for a single person)・JPY 59,500 (for family). <p>However, international students usually spend more on food due to the difference in the food available in Japan. Students who are accompanied by their family members should expect to pay approximately 1.5 to 1.6 times more in monthly living expenses.</p> <p>Please plan your budget carefully so that financial worry will not prevent you from studying.</p>";

function schoolExpense(){
  document.getElementById('paragraph').innerHTML="<p>Tuition fees in Japan are actually relatively affordable, especially when compared with those in the US and the UK. Fees for international students are fairly low and there are a number of scholarships that students can apply to for financial assistance. For example, fees at the high ranking University of Tokyo start at 485,900 yen (£3,520) for undergraduates.There is also a 248,500 yen (£1,800) admission fee. However, do not assume that the more elite universities will charge higher tuition fees as some lesser-known institutions are known to charge higher.</p><p> Another prestigious university, Kyoto University charges a much higher fee of 535,800 yen (£3,900), but it would be rare for fees to exceed this. On top of tuition fees, students will also have to pay an admission fee which will usually be around 282,000 yen (£2,000). Tuition fees will vary between different universities so be sure to check the rates at the particular universities you are interested in.</p> ";
