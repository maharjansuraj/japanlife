      <p>Harassment is defined as any remarks or behavior by a member in the context of education, research and/or administration regarding other member' gender, sexuality,age, nationality, ethnicity, physical features, birthplace, family relations, occupation, faith, or other social status and personal characteristics, that result in disadvantage orharm to other members, and/or violate their personal dignity, against the will or agreement of other members.</p>
      <h3>Examples of Harassment</h3>
      <p>In an educational, academic or work environment, harassment can be categorized into three types: sexual, academic and power harassment. However, the boundaries between these different types of harassment are not always distinct, since most harassment cases involve more than one type of harassment.</p>
      <h4>Academic Harassment</h4>
      <p>Discriminatory remarks or behavior by a member in a position of educational or academic authority, against the will or agreement of members in subordinate positions, that restrain their free academic study and research activities, impede these members in fulfilling their work responsibilities, and/or violate the individual’s personal dignity.</p>
      <p>Examples</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An academic supervisor forcing a supervisee to handle his or her personal affairs or tasks that are unrelated to education or research; acting in a discriminatory manner and/or giving unfavorable evaluations when such demands are refused.</li>
        <li>Impeding another member’s academic research activities by disposing of or restricting the use of papers, books, materials, or equipment that are necessary for research, without legitimate reasons</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Power Harassment</h4>
      <p>Abuse of supervisorial or managerial authority, or threats to damage the working environment, by a person in a higher position, who treats members in subordinate positions unfairly, causing them disadvantage, and/or violates their personal dignity.</p>
      <p>Examples</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Repeatedly mentioning failures or mistakes by someone of a lower status, and/or shouting at him or her in front of others</li>
        <li>Forcing members to drink alcohol at parties</li>
        <li>A group of members bullying a single individual</li>
      </ul>
      <h4> Sexual Harassment</h4>
      <p>Sexual remarks and/or behavior against the will or agreement of other members, which result in disadvantage and/or harm to them, or violate their personal dignity.</p>
      <p> Examples</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A supervisor frequently inviting a specific student to his or her office; forcing the student to accompany him or her to dinner after work and/or imposing physical contact</li>
        <li>Forcing a student to sit next to a faculty member in a club or seminar party; forcing him or her to pour drinks and to sing duets in karaoke</li>
        <li>Making remarks based on gender stereotypes, such as 'A man/woman should behave like this’</li>
        <li>Making obscene and/or sexual remarks about another individual’s appearance</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Declaration of Harassment Prevention</h4>
        <p>Respecting personal dignity in accordance with the spirit of the Japanese Constitution, Student Support has established these Guidelines for Harassment Prevention (the Guidelines) in order to create and protect an environment properly conducive to education, research, and other activities for its students, faculty, and administrative staff (members).</p>
        <p>As an educational and research institution that aims to nurture human resources with humanity and global compatibility, the center recognizes its responsibility to build a community in which members treat one another with respect, and will strive to promote and protect a comfortable, harassment-free environment for education, research, and other activities. In order to do so, the service center will make every effort to achieve the following: to enable its members to understand and follow the Guidelines; to build an environment in which its members feel comfortable to consult the Harassment Prevention Committee about harassment; and to take prompt and appropriate measures against harassment, including investigation, victim support, the prevention of future recurrence of harassment and the protection of privacy.</p>
        <h3> Harassment Consultation</h3>
        <h4>If you feel that an act of harassment is being committed</h4>
        <p>It is not your fault if you are harassed, so please do not suffer in silence. The support Consultation Desks are there to help you.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is advisable to keep a detailed record of when and where the incident occurs, and what has been done to you. An accurate record of harassment enables swift resolution.</li>
          <li>It is also important to keep a record of all threatening or unpleasant emails, phone-calls, faxes, etc.</li>
          <li>Please consult the Harassment Consultation Desks before a situation becomes serious.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Any unwelcome remarks or behaviors that cause discomfort to other individuals may constitute harassment.</h4>
        <p>The following may all be recognized as harassment: repeating unwelcome demands of other individuals; causing or threatening to disadvantage them if the demands are refused; making unpleasant remarks or engaging in inappropriate behavior in situations where the other party, due to their inferior status, would find it difficult or impossible to say ‘No’.</p>
        <h4>If you feel uncomfortable, awkward, and/or threatened</h4>
        <p>Tell the person promptly and clearly that you feel uncomfortable to prevent or end harassment. In many situations your feelings will not be understood if you speak in an indirect manner. It is important to make clear what makes you feel uncomfortable and what you do not want done to you. However, it is not your fault if you have been harassed. If you find it difficult to express your feelings of discomfort because of your status, please ask for the support of people whom you can trust. Under certain circumstances, it may still be difficult to speak up. When you find it difficult to refuse something, or when the person in question does not stop their actions despite your requests, do not try to deal with the problem alone. Please consult someone you can trust, or visit a consultation desk of the Harassment Prevention Committee. Student Service Support will provide support for you and work with you to solve any problem you might be facing.</p>
        <h4>If you witness an incident of harassment</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Ignoring incidents may result in further harassment. If possible, tell the person on the spot that he or she is committing harassment.</li>
          <li>Listen carefully to the harassed person. Tell him or her that they are not to blame.</li>
          <li>Ask the harassed person what he or she would like to do. You may advise the victim to visit the consultation desks of the Harassment Prevention Committee, and accompany him or her to them. You can also act as a witness in any subsequent investigation if needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anyone may, albeit unconsciously, make inappropriate remarks or behave inappropriately in the eyes of others. Let us all be aware of the risks of harassment, and build relationships in which we can alert one another of acts of harassment.</p>

  document.getElementById('paragraph').innerHTML="<h3> Living Expense</h3><p>Cost of living in Japan is the high. The average monthly expense (tuition fees not included) for typical Students is JPY 145,000. This will include an average rent of JPY 53,200 (for a single person)・JPY 103,800 (for family) and an average cost of food JPY 32,200 (for a single person)・JPY 59,500 (for family). <p>However, international students usually spend more on food due to the difference in the food available in Japan. Students who are accompanied by their family members should expect to pay approximately 1.5 to 1.6 times more in monthly living expenses.</p> <p>Please plan your budget carefully so that financial worry will not prevent you from studying.</p>";

function schoolExpense(){
  document.getElementById('paragraph').innerHTML="<p>Tuition fees in Japan are actually relatively affordable, especially when compared with those in the US and the UK. Fees for international students are fairly low and there are a number of scholarships that students can apply to for financial assistance. For example, fees at the high ranking University of Tokyo start at 485,900 yen (£3,520) for undergraduates.There is also a 248,500 yen (£1,800) admission fee. However, do not assume that the more elite universities will charge higher tuition fees as some lesser-known institutions are known to charge higher.</p><p> Another prestigious university, Kyoto University charges a much higher fee of 535,800 yen (£3,900), but it would be rare for fees to exceed this. On top of tuition fees, students will also have to pay an admission fee which will usually be around 282,000 yen (£2,000). Tuition fees will vary between different universities so be sure to check the rates at the particular universities you are interested in.</p> ";
